mym - My own music manager.

This is a super-simple music library manager wrapping mplayer.  It is very UNIXy and is designed for people who know how to use the filesystem.  I basically wanted rating behavior comparable to that of Google Play Music, but without having to deal with the cloud and the browser.

type ./mym -help for usage info.
