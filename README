mym - My own music manager.

This is a super-simple music library manager wrapping mplayer.  It is very
UNIXy and is designed for people who know how to use the filesystem.  I
basically wanted rating behavior comparable to that of Google Play Music, but
without having to deal with the cloud and the browser.

type ./mym -help for usage info.

Since every operation of this music manager is done with a shell command,
it's very amenable to being controlled with global keyboard shortcuts.  I
recommend having some shortcuts that mirror mplayer's keyboard interface.
